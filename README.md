# Monkeypox-Dectection-and-Classification
Utilizing the VGG16 architecture as the foundational model, the project will implement transfer learning techniques to adapt the model specifically for detecting features and patterns associated with Monkeypox. Fine-tuning of the model's parameters will be conducted to enhance its performance in Monkeypox detection. Additionally, a custom CNN tailored to the characteristics of Monkeypox will be developed, designed to capture relevant patterns in medical imaging data unique to the disease. Hyperparameters and layer configurations will be optimized to improve the effectiveness of this custom CNN. A comprehensive dataset of medical images related to Monkeypox will be collected and curated, ensuring diversity in cases and encompassing various stages and manifestations of the disease. This dataset will be annotated with relevant labels for training and evaluation purposes. A robust training regimen will be implemented for both the Transfer Learning Modified VGG16 and Custom CNN models, fine-tuning them using the Monkeypox dataset to optimize their performance. Techniques such as data augmentation will be employed to enhance the models' generalization capabilities. Thorough evaluations using appropriate Accuracy, specificity, sensitivity, and area beneath the receiver's operational curve of characteristics (AUC) will be conducted on both training and validation datasets to assess the models' performance. A comparing between the Transfer-learning Modified VGG16 and Custom CNN algorithms will be made to determine their effectiveness in 
Monkeypox detection[8]. Furthermore, an intuitive interface will be designed and developed for healthcare professionals, facilitating easy input of medical images for Monkeypox detection and providing timely predictions based on the trained models. The interface will be user-friendly, responsive, and accessible across different devices and platforms. The entire process of model development, including methodologies, datasets used, and results obtained, will be documented comprehensively, along with providing detailed documentation for model deployment and usage. A detailed report summarizing the project objectives, methodologies, findings, and recommendations will be prepared to encapsulate the project's outcomes.
